# Kasper Template Design  

This is a responsive website template built using only HTML and CSS. It features a modern and clean design with a beautiful slider and a user-friendly navigation menu. The template is fully responsive, making it compatible with different screen sizes and devices.  

This project is purely front-end and is intended for design purposes only, without any backend functionality.
